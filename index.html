            <div class="card-text">Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are premier engineering institutions in India
                known for their academic excellence, research contributions, and strong industry connections. While they
                share the common goal of providing quality education in engineering and technology, there are some
                differences between individual IITs. These differences can be attributed to factors such as location,
                age, faculty, facilities, and specializations.
                The cutoff scores for admissions into different IITs can vary depending on factors such as the
                popularity of the institute, the number of seats available, and the competition level.
                Overall, while all IITs maintain a high standard of education and research, these differences make each
                IIT a unique institution, attracting students with varying interests and aspirations. As a result,
                students often consider these factors along with their academic and career goals while choosing an IIT
                for their studies.
                While the core engineering disciplines are offered in all IITs, some institutes may have stronger
                expertise and focus in specific areas, such as aerospace engineering, computer science, biotechnology,
                etc. This can influence the research opportunities available to students.</div>

            <div class="card-text">The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) offer a wide range of branches and
                specializations in the field of engineering and technology. These institutes aim to provide
                comprehensive education across various disciplines to cater to the diverse interests and career
                aspirations of students. The branches offered by IITs can vary slightly from institute to institute, but
                generally, the following branches are available
                These are just a few examples of the branches offered by IITs. It's important to note that the
                availability of specific branches may vary across different IITs, and new branches may be introduced
                based on emerging technologies and industry demands. Additionally, some IITs may offer interdisciplinary
                programs that combine multiple branches or allow students to specialize in specific areas within a
                broader field..</div>
